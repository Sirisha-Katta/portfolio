        <p class="info">This software enables you to learn about the weather forecast for a certain city and also obtains your device's location and provides weather information by pressing the get device location button. The faults are also handled by this app. When a city's name isn't input, it reads "city not entered," and when the name is misspelt, it says "city not found."</p>
